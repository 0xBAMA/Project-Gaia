# Project Gaia

[Live demo](https://matejjan.github.io/Project-Gaia/index.html?world=1)

Project Gaia is a calm simulation of nature reclaiming the wasteland that humanity left behind.
Use the mouse to pan, zoom, and rotate, *t* to show temperature, *h* for humidity, *c* to auto-rotate the camera. 
Numbers in the bottom-left are links to different worlds.
